### About Me

This is a pretty new and back burner project so please be patient
with the slow construction progress. This will be my second personal website, the first being another freely hosted deal from middle school.


I am a currently masters student at the University of Rhode Island [Graduate School of Oceanography](http://www.gso.uri.edu). I primarily study subduction zone geodynamics using analogue laboratory models and computer vision with Chris Kincaid. Our lab group does all sorts of fluid dynamics from mantle convection to shellfish larval transport using integrated data and modeling methods.

### What you will find here

I plan to use this site to record all sorts of things such as general blog posts, code projects, household hacks, car maintenance, and any other info that I have spent enough effort compiling that I feel it is worth sharing. Additionally I eventually plan to create a page for my research and publications etc. Also a photo gallery would be pretty neat, we'll see how far I get. I intend to showcase solutions to problems I have had to solve and research enough to warrant writing it all down.

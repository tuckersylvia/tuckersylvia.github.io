## Welcome to  the tuckersylvia.com GitHub repository
This is the repository for my personal website, tuckersylvia.com, hosted freely on GitHub Pages. Here I will attempt to publish occasional posts of projects I work on, tidbits and obscure how tos I find, and general things that interest me and warrant sharing. I hope to get used tot he blg like a hacker workflow using the Jekyll integration, but might revert back to my python roots and use the Nikola SSG for publishing, but time will tell. i Hope to create a reasonable home/landing page, an about/contact page, a cv/pubications/research interests page, a code projects page, a car repair page, and some more generaly blog posty kind of stuff. Feel free to browse the repo, it contains all the assets and content used to build the site.

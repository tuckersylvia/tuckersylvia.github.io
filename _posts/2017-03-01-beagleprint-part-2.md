# Beagleprint Part Deux: Octoprint Configuration

## Because one must have network control...

Here is the second and most likely last installment in the 3d printer - Beaglebone - Octoprint setup series. I hope to cover all of the software stuff here because I feel that most of the relevant hardware info was covered in [Part1](link to part one here). 

###Octoprint config

###getting in from the internet

ssh tunneling

###issues, resets, bad serial, etc. probably need a nice new usb cable.
